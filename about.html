        <h2 class="about-section-title">Background</h2>
        <p>My journey into software development began in 9th grade. That first introduction to website building in HTML was truly fascinating, and from that point on, I knew I would become a software developer.</p>

        <p>For the past 11 years, I've had the opportunity to work on a range of exciting and challenging problems. This has included everything from developing complex enterprise applications and developing to state-of-the-art AI methods to working on groundbreaking robotics and bringing new products from concept to reality.</p>

        <h2 class="about-section-title">Interests & Philosophy</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Learning is a huge part of who I am. When something truly intrigues me, I'm driven to dig deep and understand it completely. I believe that to truly understand something it must make fundamental sense to you, it must fit in your mental model. This often requires digging quite deep.</p>
        <p>For example, last year I bought a couple of ESP32 kits, as I missed working with electronics. This led me down the rabbit hole, from Arduino, to ESP-IDF, to learning about how freeRTOS works and why SPI often requires specialized hardware.</p>

        <p>On a side note, I've always struggled with visual design. My hope is that the latest advancements in AI tools will finally empower me to work on projects that are not only functional but also visually appealing.</p>

        <h2 class="about-section-title">When I'm Not Coding</h2>
        <p>Outside of work, you'll often find me bouldering, both indoors and outdoors. I also enjoy working on projects around my house, I just like building things. I also like playing games, at my house we are currently hooked on Deadlock.</p>
